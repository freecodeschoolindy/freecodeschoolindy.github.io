# Class Content

This course provides an introduction to web development principles that can be utilized across multiple web frameworks with the overall goal of building responsive web applications. 
The principles of creating web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms will be addressed through both lectures and active approaches of problem solving and case discussions.

Web development is central to the operation of every organization. This course explores the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The end goal is to provide students with the tools necessary to create their own web applications. 
For students pursuing a career in web development, the topics provide the foundation for an immersion in the field of frontend web development. 
Students pursuing non-web developer careers will receive an overview of how to create and maintain their own websites.
