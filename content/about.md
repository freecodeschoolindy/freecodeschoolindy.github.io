### What is **freeCodeCamp Indy**

We are a group that meets regularly to hold events around learning to code, coding with others, support for those learning, and talks on topics relevant to this field. The group began in 2015 and has held monthly talks/workshops, and occasional mini-hackathons and code-n-coffee's. Each event is free and marked on Meetup.com.
